# Java Enum

Java Enums are a special kind of class used to define a fixed set of constants. They are particularly useful for representing a collection of related constants such as days of the week, states, directions, and so on. Enums provide a type-safe way to define and work with these constants, avoiding many issues associated with traditional constant definitions using `public static final`.

### Basic Enum Usage

Defining a simple enum `Day` representing the days of the week:

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
}
```

Using the enum:

```java
public class EnumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Day day = Day.MONDAY;

        switch (day) {
            case MONDAY:
                System.out.println("It's Monday!");
                break;
            case FRIDAY:
                System.out.println("It's Friday!");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("It's another day.");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Enums with Constructors and Fields

Enums can have fields, constructors, and methods. For example, defining an enum with color names and their RGB values:

```java
public enum Color {
    RED("#FF0000"),
    GREEN("#00FF00"),
    BLUE("#0000FF");

    private String hexCode;

    // Constructor
    private Color(String hexCode) {
        this.hexCode = hexCode;
    }

    // Getter for the hex code
    public String getHexCode() {
        return hexCode;
    }
}
```

Using the enum with fields:

```java
public class EnumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Color color = Color.RED;
        System.out.println(color + " hex code is " + color.getHexCode());
    }
}
```

### Methods in Enums

Enums can also have methods, including overriding the `toString` method. For example:

```java
public enum Operation {
    PLUS {
        @Override
        public double apply(double x, double y) {
            return x + y;
        }
    },
    MINUS {
        @Override
        public double apply(double x, double y) {
            return x - y;
        }
    },
    TIMES {
        @Override
        public double apply(double x, double y) {
            return x * y;
        }
    },
    DIVIDE {
        @Override
        public double apply(double x, double y) {
            return x / y;
        }
    };

    public abstract double apply(double x, double y);
}
```

Using the enum with methods:

```java
public class EnumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 5;
        double y = 2;

        for (Operation op : Operation.values()) {
            System.out.printf("%f %s %f = %f%n", x, op, y, op.apply(x, y));
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Defining and Using Simple Enums**: Use the `enum` keyword to define a set of related constants, commonly used for fixed sets of values.
2. **Enums with Fields and Methods**: Enums can include fields, constructors, and methods, allowing for more complex definitions and operations similar to classes.
3. **Overriding Methods**: Enums can define and override methods, enabling each enum instance to have different behaviors.

Enums provide a type-safe way to define constants and organize related data and behavior, making code clearer and easier to maintain.
